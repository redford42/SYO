So...     
I am gonna write this in english then 90% of my colleagues won't be interested of reading this :)
Here is today's recode
---
Recently we are docking with other company,which is a Internet-company.           
My company is a software one,we iterate our product twice a year.      
Well,the rest time of year,we are either prepare for next iteration or packing some hotfix.   
This time's docking is based on the end of last year's docking.   
And then,I found 5,not 1,5 bugs of that time's docking.Fu*k.Am I a programmer or a tester?
Oh and this project,this god damn project's requirements is getting more and more.Who is this project's manager?
ME!Fu*k.    
At the beginning of this project,I am nobody.     
First,this docking involved like every module of this company.I only into this company for 7 months that time.    
Second,my salary says that I am not supposed to run! this! project! Fu*k.     
And suddenlyï¼Œevery senior in this project is business travel to Beijing???Is this some kind of team build not include me???   
I also find like 4 bugs of the company we are docking with.hhh Maybe it's right time run into testing career.
